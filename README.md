**Multichat System Project**
Overview:

Design and implement a multichat system using Java socket programming. The goal is
to create a server that facilitates communication between multiple clients in a chat-like
environment.

Project Components:

Server Implementation:

Develop a server application that listens for incoming client connections.
Implement a mechanism to handle multiple clients concurrently.

Maintain a set of connected clients and ensure proper synchronization to handle
simultaneous messages.

Client Implementation:
Create a client application that connects to the server.
Implement a thread to listen for messages from the server and display them to the user.

Allow the user to input messages to be sent to the server and subsequently broadcasted
to all connected clients.

Communication Protocol:

Define a simple communication protocol between the server and clients. Specify how
messages should be formatted and transmitted.

Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling mechanisms on both the server and client sides.
Consider scenarios such as connection failures, unexpected disconnections, or invalid
messages.

User Interface:

If you want to take the project further, consider adding a basic user interface for the client
application to enhance the user experience.

Documentation:

Provide comprehensive documentation for your project. Include clear instructions on how
to compile, run, and test the server and client applications.
